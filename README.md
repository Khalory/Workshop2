I have had massive problems with rebasing due to an OS-related problem on Windows.
I'm using a Japanese system locale and that's messing up some of the internal
commands because my file paths use a different symbol than '\' (though I
have no idea why). I really have no idea what happened in the end. I somehow
managed to copy all my commits (except the one we were trying to delete) and
included them as new commits instead of replacing old ones. Due to this,
following the commands exactly just doesn't work. I spent like 4 hours trying
to figure it out and have given up. I've included a third image with some
of my errors.
