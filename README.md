# Workshop-2
On the outside always looking. Will I
ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap tap, tappin' on the glass.
Waving through a window. I
try to speak but nobody can hear so I
wait around for an answer to appear
'Cause I'm watch watch, watchin' people pass.
Waving through a window.
